  "description": "OUR MISSION\n\nCalibrate's mission is to change the way the world treats weight. We're defining a new category in metabolic health that mirrors what the research shows—that weight reflects our biology, not our willpower. Our program was designed by world leaders in obesity and nutrition science to improve metabolic health and drive long-term weight loss that's impactful, realistic, and sustainable.\n\nObesity is America's underlying pandemic and largest category of chronic disease, and Calibrate is closing the gap in care for 175mm adults in a $600bn market where we spend millions of dollars each year and do not lose millions of pounds.\n\nTo bring Calibrate to everyone who needs it, we're building the first telemedicine business within the healthcare ecosystem, aligning incentives for consumers, doctors, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. We've built a proprietary Vertical Pharmacy Engine to connect our members to the most efficient path to insurance coverage, paving the way for a new model of chronic disease care.\n\nCalibrate's first product, the One-Year Metabolic Reset, brings decades of clinical research directly to consumers through a virtual program combining FDA-approved prescription medication with intensive lifestyle intervention. The 52-week structured program includes biweekly 1:1 video coaching and curriculum that spans classes, recipes, workouts, and more. A purpose-built app enables daily tracking of food, energy level, weight, and bi-weekly goals and helps members interact with their Coaching and Medical teams, while a members' group and events calendar create additional opportunities to tap into the Calibrate community.\n\nCalibrate's recently launched Masters Program keeps members engaged and supported in their metabolic health beyond their first year with the same evidence-based approach that defines Calibrate's One-Year Metabolic Reset, at a lower cost. The result is a program that sustains and builds on members' results with improved whole-body health that enables them to embrace a new day-to-day.\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe're looking for an experienced Data Analyst who is passionate about numbers, manipulating data and ultimately changing the way the world treats weight. This analyst will report into the Data Analytics team, but will work closely with all teams across the company, analyzing data that relate to clinical efficacy, user experience, product impact, and financial success.\n\nOur Ideal candidate has 3+ years of experience in analytical roles, and has owned data and insights in early-stage startups. You should be comfortable as an individual contributor as well as a great collaborator with excellent communication skills and a genuine interest in analytics. You are curious, a self-starter and willing to work with minimum guidance in a fast-paced environment.\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nPerform regular as well as ad-hoc analyses around key business questions pertaining to all aspects of the business\nHelp establish the KPIs for each team across the business and set up regular reporting cadence for operating and financial metrics\nBuild and maintain reports and dashboards around the key metrics, and set up key stakeholders across the business to access and leverage the reports for day-to-day decision making\nWork cross-functionally to surface actionable insights for improving our experience end-to-end; communicate these insights clearly to partners across the organization\nWork closely with the Data Engineering team to guarantee data integrity and readiness\n\nBACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE\n\nProficient with SQL (any dialect)\nExperience contributing to building reporting, charts, data visualizations with Business Intelligence Tools (ex. Mode Analytics, Looker, Tableau)\nStrong knowledge of Excel/Google Sheets for data manipulation\nExperience with reading and writing in Python not required, but a big plus\nAbility to effectively communicate with technical and non-technical audiences, as well as translate operational questions into comprehensive queries and data reports\nStrong ability to work cross-functionally and manage stakeholder relationships amongst different departments\nComfortable with Git (or any other versioning tool) and Pull Requests\nNot required but pluses: comfort with predictive modeling techniques, basic experience around Data Engineering concepts\n\nABOUT OUR TEAM\n\nCalibrate launched Summer 2020, and in 18 months has raised $127.6mm in funding from leading healthcare and consumer investors, including Founders Fund, Tiger Global, Forerunner Ventures, Threshold Ventures, Optum Ventures, and Redesign Health. Our team helped build businesses at the intersection of technology, consumer, and healthcare, including Athenahealth, Capsule, Flatiron Health, Harry's, One Medical, Galileo, PillPack, Rent the Runway, and more. Our Clinical Advisors include Donna Ryan, the past President of the World Obesity Federation, and Darriush Mozafarrian, cardiologist and Dean at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.\n\nCalibrate is committed to bringing together people from different backgrounds and perspectives to deliver real results for our members.\n\nBENEFITS\n\nAt Calibrate, we're committed to our vision of putting our members and our teammates in control of their health. Some of our benefits include:\n\nCompetitive salary with opportunity for equity in an early stage, high growth business\nGenerous paid time off\nCalibrate-funded health benefits (medical, dental, vision) - starting at zero cost to you\nOne Medical membership and Teladoc virtual care\nFertility, gynecology, and wellness services through Kindbody\nTherapy on your time with a free year of Talkspace membership\nHealth advocacy and assistance services through Health Advocate\nCommuter benefits, ClassPass memberships, and gym memberships for post-pandemic life\nNYC-based with opportunities to be fully remote\nCompetitive Paid Parental Leave for parents\n\nOUR VALUES\n\nWe're in it together: We have an audacious mission, and we're building a lot of things for the first time — from the first DTC pharma business within the healthcare ecosystem to the data infrastructure for providing real-world evidence in the largest category of chronic disease. It takes superpowers to build something simple and intuitive within the complex healthcare market, so we identify and work as a team from our individual points of strength. Not everyone has to be good at everything, but we know that when we harness what we're each great at, we're unstoppable.\n\nSmall wins create big wins: We ground every experience in optimism, recognizing and celebrating successes along the way. We break projects down into smaller components. And we focus on where we have momentum. We always plan for larger goals with the knowledge that our plans will evolve as we achieve smaller milestones.\n\nYou're in control: While we're headquartered in New York, we don't let location stand in the way of the best talent — and from coaches to engineers, many of us are fully remote. Our business is multi-faceted, so each Calibrater is hired to be an expert in their piece of it — in control of their own initiatives, in control of their own impact, and in control of driving their own (real) results.\n\nReal results matter: We're obsessed with outcomes because when our members win, we win, and the data proves that we've built the best metabolic health program on the market. We're purposeful, optimistic, and relentlessly confident that we can solve the biggest medical issue of the 21st century.\n\nCalibrate recruits, employs, compensates, and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, disability, age, veteran status, and other protected status as required by applicable law and as a matter of our company values.\n\nLI-REMOTE"

  "description": "Our mission\n\nWe're making Africa the first cashless continent.\n\nIn 2017, nearly 60% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.\n\nWe're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In November 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. In 2019, we expanded to Cote d'Ivoire. Now, we have millions of users and are growing fast. Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent.

The main gaps and capacity constraints she/he will address are:Troubleshooting/Managing expectations: Currently, the team’s work to launch campaigns is consistently impacted by multiple requests from Sales Ops, SDRs, and Revenue Org in general that relate to reporting, CRM, and data (e.g., Salesforce and Pardot automation rules, legacy implementation issues, MQL workflows/anomalies, TAM requests, list parsing and manipulation).

  "description": "We are looking for resourceful data analysts to own some of our highest impact problems.\n\nDandy's Data program is racing to catch up to the rest of the company. Dandy has extraordinarily complex operational and technical challenges (and some very impressive people working to meet these challenges) - data is one of the central keys to its success. The opportunities for personal growth in this position are extremely high. You will be pushed to the edge of your comfort zone but strongly supported technically and organizationally by a kind, diverse, low ego, extremely intelligent, extremely effective team. Dandy is an extremely high growth startup - though the company is on a rocketship trajectory, it is still early enough to get started within the positive environment of a smaller organization.\n\nData analysts own everything from data stewardship through to strategy analysis, including: structuring the problem and key metrics, data capture design, analytic frameworks, product design analysis, data/analysis accessibility for business partners, deep-dive strategic analyses. Your role will be problem(s)-based, and will likely involve driving all of these components. Data analysts here become relatively independent technically - we say that our analysts are \"full stack\". We serve every department in the company.\n\nAbout Dandy\n\nDandy is a business-in-a-box for dentists. Our vision is to become the operating system for every dental office in America by leading the transition to digital dentistry for the $200 billion industry. You can see our current offerings here (note that the list is expanding quickly!). Headquartered in New York City, Dandy is backed by the world's leading venture capital investors.\n\nData Analytics and Data Science are a fundamental part of Dandy's core offerings and are key pillars for its success. We are constantly adding new product offerings or taking over more pieces of our (very complex) supply chain, and we suspect that there will be plenty of very interesting fundamental data problems for a very long time.\n\nAbout Dandy Data\n\nDandy's data program is newly led by a team with a proven track record of building data practices at hypergrowth companies. We are all aligned on the mission of propelling the company to market dominance. Simultaneously, we also believe that promoting individual growth is part and parcel of this mission and the best way to achieve success. Whether you want to grow technically (self-directed training days every quarter, technical discussions at dandy run from analytics tools through to ML for point-cloud image segmentation) or organizationally (all work is highly cross functional, we want you to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible, opportunities for management exist as well if that interests you) we think Dandy is the place for you. You will be strongly supported in pushing your comfort zone as far out as makes sense, and the opportunities for doing that here are much more numerous than most places. We also have some pretty cool custom Data infrastructure and tooling which we like to think makes every analyst on our team several times more effective than under a regular paradigm.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOwn every part of the data and strategy cycle for your problem(s) - data capture design, strategy and metrics development, analytics frameworks, accessible reporting, coaching of business stakeholders, deep dive analyses, etc\nBe a cross functional leader, bringing together all business groups and technical groups to get the job done\nOwn your problem space itself. Be a full partner to business/technical stakeholders.\n\nAsk the questions no one has thought of, and figure out when a full reframing might be necessary.\n\nOwn all data delivery and reporting for your space\n\nRequirements\n\nTechnical dexterity: you will get up to speed on SQL + very basic python in your first few days and then add on new tools/methods/etc thereafter as is relevant to your problem space\nAnalytic mind and methodical approach.\nYou onboard onto new business problems quickly and can think just like your stakeholders.\nAbility to understand a complex problem space quickly from angles such as data capture, data availability/accessibility/communication, product design, process design, machine intelligence techniques for scaling\nDesire to work cross functionally and learn how to lead cross functional projects\nCommunication: (1) you already communicate effectively with a technical audience (2) you cam communicate effectively and independently with a wide range of non-technical stakeholders and desire to keep improving here\nTrack record of ownership\nTrack record of curiosity and motivation\nDentistry experience is not required!\n\nBonus Points\n\nDBT + Looker + python experience\nAdvanced experience in any of the above requirements\nBasic ML\nDirect experience in Data Analytics\nAn advanced technical degree"
