  "description": "Reports To: Data AnalystType: Full-TimeLocation: Chicago, ILCompensation:  Competitive salary + full suite of benefitsBackground Twenty years ago, when educators and community members started the charter school movement, people questioned whether students in low-income communities could succeed at the highest levels. That debate is now over. They can, and they do, as evidenced by the high school graduation rates and post-secondary success of thousands of Illinois charter school students. The only remaining question is whether we have the will to make this happen for more families. That is the work we are committed to.The Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) advocates for the improvement of public education by leveraging the charter school model as a catalyst to transform lives and communities. INCS works to ensure that charter public schools have adequate and equitable resources, the autonomy to find innovative approaches to meet student needs, and a fair and transparent policy landscape that allows high-quality options to thrive. As the voice of Illinois charter schools, INCS engages a diverse coalition of policy-makers, school leaders, parents, and community members to create systemic change and secure high-quality schools for underserved communities.INCS has distinguished itself as a powerful catalyst for creating and sustaining high-quality charter schools and education reform in Illinois. Charter advocacy work in Illinois is particularly compelling given the charter school movement's legislative victories in recent years, which lifted the state's cap on charter public schools from 60 to 120 charters, created an authorizing commission independent of school districts, and increased the allowable renewal term from five to ten years for high performing charter schools.The charter community needs an advocate to ensure policy-makers and families know accurate facts about charter schools and understand their valuable contributions to Illinois communities and the health of our state's public-school ecosystem. INCS is that advocate. INCS' Data Analyst will be a crucial asset in this effort, setting strategy for how INCS will leverage quantitative and qualitative findings of charter schools to drive a policy environment that supports the sustainability of charter schools to transform lives and communities across Illinois and overseeing the organization's data and information-sharing platforms to achieve sustainable results in team operations.INCS makes its impact through several program teams: Government Affairs, Charter Growth andSupport, Data and Policy, and Communications. The organization is based in Chicago, where the majority of Illinois' charter schools are located.THE SEARCH We are looking for a passionate Data Analyst. The successful candidate will turn data into information, and information into insight, and insight into business decisions.

We’re looking for a smart, data-driven individual to join our team as a Business Intelligence Analyst.\nData analysis and reporting is some of the most important work we do here at PerkSpot. In this role, you will work with the rest of the Business Intelligence team to build and maintain reports that directly track company KPIs and determine if new features are running properly. Your reports will also allow users to obtain information directly pertaining to their accounts. Your work will serve to improve the overall effectiveness of our platform, while informing key decision makers about customer needs and where to invest future efforts.\nAbout PerkSpot\nPerkSpot is an employee benefits company that works with America’s top employers to offer exclusive discounts, rewards, and recognition to millions of employees. These exclusive perks and savings are a great recruitment and retention tool that allows employees to take advantage of unique opportunities and feel great about the company they work for. We help employees from over 1,000 companies like Spotify, Walgreens, McDonald's, and Lyft save on everything from gym memberships and movie tickets to electronics, new cars, and travel.\nProfitable and growing, our company was founded in 2006 by good people with a great vision, and we’re carrying on the work they started. In 2018, our company was proud to announce an additional investment of $50 million dollars from Susquehanna Growth Equity. As we continue to grow, we’re excited about our leadership position in the industry, but we’re also committed to doing more - developing better products, reaching more employers, and getting more employees engaged with our platform. Our passion is to make every place a great place to work, starting with our own. We’re a big platform, but a small team. That means we’re going to trust you with more responsibility than you’d have anywhere else and invest in your success and growth more than any other employer.\nMeet the Business Intelligence Team\nThe Business Intelligence team is made up of like-minded individuals who are dedicated to PerkSpot’s success. We work diligently to manage current and future reporting projects, develop and execute SQL queries, and maintain our current warehouse structure. All of this work is done to make sure that PerkSpot’s data reporting is as accurate and thorough as possible. The Business Intelligence team also collaborates with every internal department on their current projects and KPIs, effectively controlling the quality of work done at PerkSpot and setting the tone for long-term, future growth.\nLife as a Business Intelligence Analyst:\nNavigating unstructured and undisciplined data sets; providing insight into how best to structure the data to derive actionable results\nWorking within our reporting dashboard to build out visualizations, assist in data flow construction, and ensuring accuracy of reporting\nReceiving and prioritizing incoming reporting and data tickets\nConducting in-depth, detailed analysis of PerkSpot’s data; presenting these findings to department heads and company leadership\nPartnering with company leadership to advise on key company decisions, like new product features and customer needs\nAddressing any urgent reporting needs or product issues promptly\nRegularly attending team meetings and brainstorming new features, solutions, and analysis ideas\nAdhering to deadlines and requirements of assigned projects\nWhat we’re looking for:\n0-3 years of experience in analytics\nBachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Business Intelligence, or similar field\nProven proficiency in SQL and high-level MS Excel\nDemonstrated background in data visualization, report development, and dashboard/flow development\nExcellent communication skills, with a proven ability to synthesize complicated data concepts into actionable solutions\nDesire to create and fulfill a long-term vision for the product and company as a whole\nWell developed critical thinking skills, with a solution-oriented mindset and not afraid to keep asking “why”\nProven ability to adhere to deadlines, stay organized, and understand project limitations\nA positive attitude, collaborative spirit, and thoughtful approach to all work\nWhat will REALLY help you stick out:\nFamiliarity with SQL and/or Domo\nExperience in a fast-paced, high-growth startup environment\nExposure to statistical software such as R, SAS, or SPSS\nProject work that demonstrates cross-departmental collaboration and results that drove the business\nYour First Few Months:\nDuring your training, you’ll work closely with our Business Intelligence Director to learn all about our existing data warehouse structure, current KPIs, and departmental/company reporting strategies. After that you’ll get right into it, helping the team to build ETLs, cards, and dashboards within our current reporting system. Soon we’ll have you writing SQL queries and dealing with ad hoc project requests, and then trust you to take charge with building out and support larger projects and working with teams to create end-to-end analytical solutions. Because of your unique position on a small team, you’ll be able to impact the company’s reporting structure and data analysis for years to come.\nThe Perks of Working at PerkSpot\nWe’re a big platform, but still a small team. That means we’re going to trust you with more responsibility than elsewhere, and invest in you more. You’re going to grow – a lot.\nWe work out of our office in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. When we are in the office, we dress how we like, encourage flexible hours and an open time-off policy, stock a good beer selection, and we’re pretty obsessive about our coffee. Most of all, we welcome good people with lots of energy and enthusiasm.\nPerkSpot offers the full suite of benefits you’d expect from a profitable, established company, including health and dental insurance, a generous parental leave policy, 401(k), pre-tax transit benefits, and fully-funded disability coverage. We have in-office bike storage, a private gym, and a shower on-site.\nWe hold weekly company get-togethers where we learn from what went wrong and celebrate what went right. Every week at PerkSpot, we aim a little higher and get a little bit better than the previous week.\nBecause we consider every member of our team to be a fundamental part of our success, we encourage everyone to be invested in our success, regardless of their position. We want every one of our employees to think like an owner: put in the effort to exceed expectations, solve problems before they come up, and always go the extra mile. It’s this drive to succeed that makes PerkSpot such an interactive and fulfilling place to work.\nChicago + Remote: We have a solid footprint in Chicago, but we also hire exceptionally talented people who reside elsewhere.\nWe love the friendships we've forged in our Chicago office. But let's be real; things have changed. We don't plan to all return 100% in-office, but our office and gym are open on an optional basis for all employees who feel comfortable, including happy hours and team events. However, because culture and relationships are important to us, all candidates should be open to being in-office with their teams at pre-arranged times throughout the year. The specifics vary by role, so please discuss your plans with the hiring team.\nHow to Apply\nAll applications will be kept strictly confidential. Please submit a resume AND cover letter (we know it is old school, but a cover letter is very important to us) telling us how you stack up to the qualifications, plus any other information you feel would be relevant to PerkSpot. Don’t be afraid to show your spark and personality!\nAll positions require a full background screening.\nOffering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture is a priority at PerkSpot. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, disability or protected veteran status, or any other legally protected basis, in accordance with applicable law.\n\nbPREXkGOuA"

  "description": "Twenty years ago, when educators and community members started the charter school movement, people questioned whether students in low-income communities could succeed at the highest levels. That debate is now over. They can, and they do, as evidenced by the high school graduation rates and post-secondary success of thousands of Illinois charter school students. The only remaining question is whether we have the will to make this happen for more families. That is the work we are committed to.\nThe Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) advocates for the improvement of public education by leveraging the charter school model as a catalyst to transform lives and communities. INCS works to ensure that charter public schools have adequate and equitable resources, the autonomy to find innovative approaches to meet student needs, and a fair and transparent policy landscape that allows high-quality options to thrive. As the voice of Illinois charter schools, INCS engages a diverse coalition of policy-makers, school leaders, parents, and community members to create systemic change and secure high-quality schools for underserved communities.\nINCS has distinguished itself as a powerful catalyst for creating and sustaining high-quality charter schools and education reform in Illinois. Charter advocacy work in Illinois is particularly compelling given the charter school movement's legislative victories in recent years, which lifted the state's cap on charter public schools from 60 to 120 charters, created an authorizing commission independent of school districts, and increased the allowable renewal term from five to ten years for high performing charter schools.\nThe charter community needs an advocate to ensure policy-makers and families know accurate facts about charter schools and understand their valuable contributions to Illinois communities and the health of our state's public-school ecosystem. INCS is that advocate. INCS' Data Analyst will be a crucial asset in this effort, setting strategy for how INCS will leverage quantitative and qualitative findings of charter schools to drive a policy environment that supports the sustainability of charter schools to transform lives and communities across Illinois and overseeing the organization's data and information-sharing platforms to achieve sustainable results in team operations.\nINCS makes its impact through several program teams: Government Affairs, Charter Growth and Support, Data and Policy, and Communications. The organization is based in Chicago, where the majority of Illinois' charter schools are located.\nTHE SEARCH\nWe are looking for a passionate Data Analyst. The successful candidate will turn data into information, and information into insight, and insight into business decisions. As a member of the External Affairs team, the Data Analyst is primarily responsible for the analysis of school quality and enrollment data for all Illinois charter schools. The Data Analyst will equip the INCS team, INCS' member schools, and influential stakeholders with data tools and research findings that will boost their efforts to impact education policy and improve school quality for students throughout Illinois. In addition, the Data Analyst leads the development and implementation of all INCS research projects, including community surveys, issue briefs, and focus groups, to support overall strategy.\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\nMaintain and update database of charter school performance data:\nMaintain and continue to improve INCS charter performance database, incorporating new sources as they become available from Chicago Public Schools, Illinois State Board of Education and other state and local agencies.\nInstall new functionality on INCS website through Tableau software and connection to server.\nStreamline data systems at INCS to reduce the burden of updating, eliminate redundancies, and make school data more accessible to staff.\nBuild dashboards in relevant platforms, such as Tableau, Excel, or PowerPoint, to support INCS teams in their work.\nEquip INCS teams with timely and relevant data analysis:\nUpdate data points on INCS website, in INCS literature, and other staff resource documents with up to date information from database and reporting platforms.\nCreate one-pagers and PowerPoints summarizing performance and enrollment trends for INCS' advocacy team.\nSupport Development team with relevant data points for competitive grant processes.\nServe as master engineer and staff support for CRM database (e.g. Salesforce), housing development, program, communications, and stakeholder interaction data:\nUnderstand, support, and address the business needs of all INCS staff members with regards to the INCS CRM database.\nMaintain seamless integration between CRM, email marketing tool, event registration tool, social media, and accounting software.\nHelp staff design and implement protocols for capturing pertinent stakeholder interaction data that is not otherwise captured in one of our data systems.\nBuild and maintain reports that support user adoption and accountability.\nServe as the champion for the organization's use of CRM, building buy-in, supporting evolving staff needs, and training new and existing staff on an as-needed basis about the functionality in CRM database.\nServe as liaison between CRM customer support resources and the end-users.\nManage maintenance of INCS website, including developing new web pages and updating content:\nLead quarterly review of INCS website content with staff, ensuring each page features current data and content.\nLiaise with INCS' external website hosting team to ensure functionality and regular WordPress backend maintenance.\nRegularly update INCS job board.\nSupervise development and implementation of INCS research projects, including community surveys, focus groups, and issue briefs:\nMaintain and improve current data collection processes across team.\nConduct original research and drive analysis for INCS issue briefs, exploring topics relevant to the charter public school community.\nTrack and manage implementation of INCS data collection projects, including survey work and focus groups.\nServe as a leader in the charter data community:\nLead INCS data working group, a collaborative space for data professionals in the charter community.\nServe as a resource for charter schools on individual and sector performance through one-on-one meetings and community-wide professional development sessions.\nWrite monthly summaries of new data reports and publications for inclusion in INCS' President's Report.\nEXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS\nFirst and foremost, candidates must believe that every child, regardless of socioeconomic factors or their academic starting point has the potential to succeed in school, career, and life. In addition, candidates must believe in the power of charter schools to leverage sustainable improvement on the public education system overall. Additional requirements include:\nRequired:\nUndergraduate degree (Sociology, Statistics, Data Analytics), Master's preferred\nExperience with relational database design and maintenance\nProficient in R, SQL, and Tableau\nAdvanced Excel and MS Office Suite\nExperience with website management and WordPress hosting\nHighly organized with excellent attention to detail and ability to independently manage multiple projects at once\nHigh expectations and focused on results\nOrientation toward customer service and problem-solving\nStrong written and verbal communication skills\nAbility to work independently, as a highly organized self‐starter\nMature outlook and presence, sense of humor, relentless optimism, a spirit of problem-solving, and calm under pressure\nPreferred:\nThree to five years of experience in a relevant field\nEducation/charter school experience\nExperience in computer science, data modeling/management, and/or statistics\nCULTURAL COMPETENCY AT INCS\nCultural competency is a lifelong process of building the knowledge, mindset, and skills necessary to engage fully and effectively with students, colleagues, and stakeholders of different backgrounds. This process requires us to deeply understand our nation's history of injustice and its link to the persistent opportunity gaps that INCS and its member schools are focused on closing. It also requires us to strengthen our cultural competency by better understanding our own implicit and explicit biases and by reflecting on our words and actions through open dialogue.\nINCS invests in building greater cultural competence and responsiveness across our team by supporting ongoing reflection, learning, skill-building, and positive actions. We know that culturally competent teams, especially when inclusive of individuals who share the racial, socioeconomic, and/or academic backgrounds (e.g., first-generation college-goers) of member schools' student populations, are best equipped to take action to ensure fairness inside and outside of INCS. To that end, we believe in building a richly diverse and inclusive organization, including a mission-critical imperative for all staff to both model and contribute to the vision we hope to achieve.\nEqual Opportunity\nINCS believes it is critical for leaders to reflect the communities that they serve, and that diversity across multiple dimensions enables us to achieve our mission of transforming lives and communities through public education. We don't just accept difference – we celebrate it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our staff, member schools, and the broader community. We are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and seek and welcome a diverse pool of candidates in this search.\nIf you want to engage full and effectively with students, parents, colleagues, and other stakeholders to help them understand the opportunity gaps that charter public schools are working to close, then apply now!\nHow to Apply:\nCandidates for the Data Analyst position are required to submit a cover letter and a current resume.\nCGYxCiDyy9"

If you are interested in more than one location, you'll be able to indicate your location preferences in the application and you do not need to apply more than once.\n\nWhat you´ll do at BTS\nAt BTS, we partner with clients to enable strategy execution. We provide the skills, tools, and knowledge so people understand how their daily work impacts business results. We are experts in behavior change, care deeply about delivering results, and inspire people do the best work of their lives.\nAs a BTS consultant, you’ll work directly with leaders from some of the world’s leading corporations. Global 100 and 500 largest companies. You’ll learn how their business works and what their strategies are, and you’ll be shaping the leadership capabilities of their senior management. A BTS consultant also cultivates the skills of thousands of developing leaders across the globe.\nWe work in small teams to develop customized business simulations and other learning solutions. Think board games with financial models, or app-based digital learning. And then we facilitate learning journeys directly with our clients in a workshop setting that incorporates humor, fun, and competition. In the world we are currently in, these workshops are virtual.\nThere are no industry verticals at BTS, and you will have all the variety you want in your clients and work. You’ll be staffed on multiple projects at one time, across different industries, and with different internal teams.\nWhen you’re not facilitating a program with your teammates, you’ll spend your time designing these amazing experiences we provide for our clients. Interviewing clients, conducting research and analysis, testing programs, laughing. You’ll laugh a lot and have a lot of fun. And this is all done in a team-based setting where our entrepreneurial culture of freedom and responsibility empowers you to contribute from your first day. As your skills and career grow, you’ll have the ability to manage client relationships, find new clients and opportunities, and grow the careers of others BTSers.\nAs we mentioned above, right now we are doing our work virtually. Eventually, and hopefully soon, we will return to working in our offices as much as we want, as well as facilitating in-person programs with our clients. For us, that’s when we travel – when we are in front of our clients leading them through the simulations and workshops we’ve created. And when we get back to “normal,” you can expect that you’ll travel around 40-50% of the time, going to different cities to facilitate the incredible experiences you’ve designed.\n\n\nWhat we are looking for\nCuriosity. Resourcefulness. A humble and inclusive spirit. These are core attributes of BTS all-stars.\nWe are also looking for entrepreneurial drive and diligence. Intellectual horsepower with strong business acumen. The courage and desire to present to a (Zoom) room that might have 50+ smart, eager people in it.\nWe do have a few requirements: solid business acumen and strong written and verbal communication skills. Eligibility to work in the US permanently without sponsorship is also a requirement."
