Everyone is encouraged to think creatively, challenge the status quo and look for solutions.\nScratch beneath the surface and you will find a business that is solid, but slightly contrary. We like to do things differently and constantly seek to evolve. We might have been around for a long time (our roots go back to 1901), but we are young in many ways, ambitious and going places. Some people might say insurance is dull, but life at Hiscox is anything but.

We see it as the best of both worlds: structure and sociability on one hand, and independence and flexibility on the other.\nYou can follow Hiscox on LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Instagram (@HiscoxInsurance)"

We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\n$2.6B Annual Revenue\n100+ Countries\n2.0B+ Transactions per Year\n8,500+ Employees\n\n(as of December 31, 2019)\n\nOur payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.\n\nFLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:\n\nForbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista\nForbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!\nFortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872\nS&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)\n\nOur Vision\n\nDespite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.\n\nOur Mission\n\nFLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nFLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:\n\nMore Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.\nMore Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:\nOur Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.\nOur Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.\n\nFor our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.\n\nMore Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.\n\nOur Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging\n\nTogether we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:\n\nWelcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;\nEmpowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and\nValuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.\n\nEmbracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Values\n\nFLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:\n\nInnovation: Figure out a better way\nExecution: Get it done quickly\nIntegrity: Do the right thing\nPeople: We make the difference\nCollaboration: Accomplish more together\n\nThese values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”\n\nOur values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.\n\nWe strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.\n\nFLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:\nDue to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.\n\nEqual Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer:\nFLEETCOR is an Equal Opportunity Employer. FLEETCOR provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, gender (including pregnancy), religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, language, ancestry, genetic information, veteran and/or military status or any other group status protected by federal or local law.

(“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\n$2.6B Annual Revenue\n100+ Countries\n2.0B+ Transactions per Year\n8,500+ Employees\n\n(as of December 31, 2019)\n\nOur payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.\n\nFLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:\n\nForbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista\nForbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!\nFortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872\nS&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)\n\nOur Vision\n\nDespite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.\n\nOur Mission\n\nFLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nFLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:\n\nMore Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.\nMore Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:\nOur Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.\nOur Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.\n\nFor our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.\n\nMore Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.\n\nOur Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging\n\nTogether we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:\n\nWelcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;\nEmpowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and\nValuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.\n\nEmbracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Values\n\nFLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:\n\nInnovation: Figure out a better way\nExecution: Get it done quickly\nIntegrity: Do the right thing\nPeople: We make the difference\nCollaboration: Accomplish more together\n\nThese values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”\n\nOur values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.\n\nWe strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.\n\nFLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:\nDue to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.\n\nEqual Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer:\nFLEETCOR is an Equal Opportunity Employer. FLEETCOR provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, gender (including pregnancy), religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, language, ancestry, genetic information, veteran and/or military status or any other group status protected by federal or local law.

Configure system settings and options; plan and execute business design, assist in integration and acceptance testing, where necessary; and create specifications for system to meet business requirements. Include analysis of business and user needs, documentation of requirements, and translation into proper system requirement specifications.\nOn a day to day basis you will:\nWork within an agile scrum team to include a ScrumMaster, Product Owner, business analyst, test analysts, application developers and client counterparts to design and deliver new products or capabilities in an iterative, continuous fashion\nDevelop detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, screen mock-ups, flow diagrams, etc. outlining the solution to be implemented\nBe accountable for assisting in the gathering and verification of non-functional requirements, review of architectures and designs, adherence to standards, and developing and implementing strategies for validating that the target requirements have been adequately addressed\nBe an active participant in all agile scrum ceremonies\nBe responsible for maintaining project and system documentation\nBe a strong advocate for the development team’s priorities and challenge and will push back on scope-creep and negotiate timelines with the product owner\nYou should apply if you:\nAre flexible, responsive, creative, innovative, accepting of change and place value on people and interactions\nAre business oriented, thinking continuously about what can be done to improve the business, and the business processes which drive the business\nAre able to retain enough independence to evaluate potential solutions based on the overall impact to the organization, rather than the influence of the particular business area and its managers\nAre able to challenge the business manager, sponsor, problem owner and users to define the real business problem behind the expressed “needs” to ensure that the solution team is solving the right problem, and not providing the right solution to the wrong problem\nAre willing to step into other roles on the agile scrum team when necessary to help the team meet defined goals\nYou would be a particularly good fit if you:\nAre able to collaborate openly within a mixed team of developers, analysts and product owners\nHave the ability to analyze a problem, organize thoughts and recommend approaches\nAre a creative thinker, comfortable pushing the boundaries of standard industry practices\nAre a self-starter looking for responsibility and a place you can make an impact\nLike to innovate and make things around you better\nHave testing and/or programming/technical experience\nAre experienced in Agile/Scrum methodology, and the development of associated project artifacts (i.e., user stories, acceptance criteria).\nBeing a Business Analyst requires flexibility, responsiveness, creativity, innovative thinking, acceptance of change and a dependence on individuals and interactions.\nAdaptability :\nThe BA defines improvements to business processes, assists decision makers in gathering information to make decisions, helps quality assurance test solutions and products, designs user interfaces and even steps in as a product owner, scrum master or project manager as the occasion calls for. The BA must be able to adapt to the business process, the development process, or even a lack of process, and to any and all management directives, and not be focused on a single process or framework.\nGoal Orientation:\nThe BA has a focus on the overall problem that will be solved when the entire project is completed. The BA is also the weathervane indicating when a project has outlived its usefulness and is becoming a zombie project. The BA, always having the goal or the solution in front of him/her, is able to determine whether the project is still on track, the problem can be solved, or the problem has already been solved. This goal orientation is the result of the BA's system thinking capabilities and the business analyst's ability to see the big picture in addition to the detailed tasks necessary to complete the next sprint.\nInnovation:\nThe BA challenges the business manager, sponsor, problem owner and users to define the real business problem behind the expressed \"needs\" to ensure that the solution team is solving the right problem, and not providing the right solution to the wrong problem.\nLeadership:\nThe BA is a leader providing solutions to business problems and continuous improvement to the organization. This leadership factor is not achieved through authority, but through influence and through facilitation and communication. A BA leads through their work with stakeholders as they build understanding of what's needed and look to the future.\nEmpathy:\nThroughout all of the BA dealings with the business sponsor, customers, process workers, users, solution team, technical personnel and upper level management, the BA exhibits empathy and understanding and provides an intermediary who is a mediator, a calming center in the midst of the storm of controversy and confrontation that usually accompanies organizational change. A certain amount of empathy is needed on an agile team in order for it to function as a high-performing team.\nBusiness Orientation:\nThe BA is thinking about what the business needs to do to solve the business problems, in addition to what the solution team needs to do. The BA is as comfortable talking to senior executives about business matters, the marketplace and competition, as to the development team about user stories.\nAnticipation:\nThe BA has to retain enough independence to evaluate potential solutions based on the overall impact to the organization rather than the influence of the particular business area and its managers. Solving a business problem solely for the business unit might have immediate benefits; solving a business problem from the perspective of the whole organization brings much more lasting value.\nWhat Are We Looking For in This Role?\nMinimum Qualifications\nBachelor's Degree\nRelevant Experience or Degree in: Computer Science, Management Information Systems, Business or related field; or equivalent training or experience in lieu of degree\nTypically Minimum 4 Years Relevant Exp\nProfessional experience working with end-users to meet business needs\n\nPreferred Qualifications\nTypically Minimum 4 Years Relevant Exp\nScripting knowledge, bankcard industry knowledge, understanding data structures, professional experience working with end-users to meet business needs\nWorking towards a Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP)\nWhat Are Our Desired Skills and Capabilities?\nSkills / Knowledge - A seasoned, experienced professional with a full understanding of area of specialization; resolves a wide range of issues in creative ways.
