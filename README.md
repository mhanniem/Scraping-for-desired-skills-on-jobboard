# Scraping-for-desired-skills-on-jobboard
Final project for Data &amp; Programming Class


This is a group final project for my data and programming class. We used APIfy to scrape joblistings from indeed using the keyword: "data analyst". We scraped from ten different locations, cleaned, and compiled it into one dataset. We then used N-grams to identify the most recurring skill sets. From there we ranked the skills based on how often employers would list each skill.
