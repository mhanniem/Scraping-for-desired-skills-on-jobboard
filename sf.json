  "description": "We are hiring Business Analysts to start their BTS careers in the summer of 2022 in the following offices: New York, NY, Chicago, IL, and San Francisco, CA. If you are interested in more than one location, you'll be able to indicate your location preferences in the application and you do not need to apply more than once.\n\nWhat you´ll do at BTS\nAt BTS, we partner with clients to enable strategy execution. We provide the skills, tools, and knowledge so people understand how their daily work impacts business results. We are experts in behavior change, care deeply about delivering results, and inspire people do the best work of their lives.\nAs a BTS consultant, you’ll work directly with leaders from some of the world’s leading corporations. Global 100 and 500 largest companies. You’ll learn how their business works and what their strategies are, and you’ll be shaping the leadership capabilities of their senior management. A BTS consultant also cultivates the skills of thousands of developing leaders across the globe.\nWe work in small teams to develop customized business simulations and other learning solutions. Think board games with financial models, or app-based digital learning. And then we facilitate learning journeys directly with our clients in a workshop setting that incorporates humor, fun, and competition. In the world we are currently in, these workshops are virtual.\nThere are no industry verticals at BTS, and you will have all the variety you want in your clients and work. You’ll be staffed on multiple projects at one time, across different industries, and with different internal teams.\nWhen you’re not facilitating a program with your teammates, you’ll spend your time designing these amazing experiences we provide for our clients. Interviewing clients, conducting research and analysis, testing programs, laughing. You’ll laugh a lot and have a lot of fun. And this is all done in a team-based setting where our entrepreneurial culture of freedom and responsibility empowers you to contribute from your first day. As your skills and career grow, you’ll have the ability to manage client relationships, find new clients and opportunities, and grow the careers of others BTSers.\nAs we mentioned above, right now we are doing our work virtually. Eventually, and hopefully soon, we will return to working in our offices as much as we want, as well as facilitating in-person programs with our clients. For us, that’s when we travel – when we are in front of our clients leading them through the simulations and workshops we’ve created. And when we get back to “normal,” you can expect that you’ll travel around 40-50% of the time, going to different cities to facilitate the incredible experiences you’ve designed.\n\n\nWhat we are looking for\nCuriosity. Resourcefulness. A humble and inclusive spirit. These are core attributes of BTS all-stars.\nWe are also looking for entrepreneurial drive and diligence. Intellectual horsepower with strong business acumen. The courage and desire to present to a (Zoom) room that might have 50+ smart, eager people in it.\nWe do have a few requirements: solid business acumen and strong written and verbal communication skills. Eligibility to work in the US permanently without sponsorship is also a requirement."
