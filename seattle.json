We do this through engaging digital experiences, face-to-face workshops and sustainable programs that encourage people to move more, shift their mindset and eat healthier while enjoying the foods they love. By drawing on over five decades of experience and expertise in behavioral science, we build communities in order to deliver wellness for all.\nRole Overview:\nWW is seeking an analyst to find interesting things in data that can tell a great story. Our data includes anonymized health-related tracking from over 5 million subscribers around the world. The analyst who fills this role will dig into our data on weight loss, physical activity, sleep, and mindset, and figure out anything that anyone would find interesting. No kidding. If you’re curious about how people establish healthy habits, this role is a chance for you to be professionally curious and get answers to your questions. The answers you find will then be used by the public relations team to pitch media and get the word out about how WW supports our members .\nThis role collaborates with Public Relations to help everyone learn about what WW offers and to help further solidify that WW is the leader in weight loss and wellness. Recent questions we have included, “Can we see what people are eating now that they are socializing more coming out of the pandemic?”, and “Are changes in eating patterns making it harder for members to lose weight?” If these kinds of questions are what you would like to dig into, this is a job for you.\nThe work includes brainstorming with Public Relations to think of interesting questions; data wrangling and a lot of SQL to find answers; and writing up findings to share results. The extent of the write-ups will vary depending on how Public Relations will use the information. Much of the research will be correlational, but WW runs a lot of experiments (A/B tests), and data on causation will be available for some questions. The role could include some machine learning to enhance the data (think fuzzy matching to find the right foods in a database).\nKey Responsibilities:\nPlan and run data analyses to discover and report interesting findings\nCollaborate with PR team on choosing what questions to pursue\nRequirements:\nRequired Experience & Skills\nGreat comfort in SQL\n5+ years experience in data analytics\nGreat write up and reporting skills\nCollaboration and presentation skills: show what is interesting and why it is interesting\nFamiliarity with research methods and statistical analysis\nFor example, understanding why correlation is not causation, and what statistical significance is\nPreferred Experience & Skills\nPublic relations; press releases; journalism\nReporting and presenting to leadership\nCross-functional consulting, collaboration, and negotiation\nPython\nR\nMachine learning\nBachelors/advanced degree in a related field\nSnowflake\nBusiness intelligence dashboarding\nAt WW, it is our priority to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workplace.

We are seeking a talent who will share our obsession for data accuracy; someone with an insatiable appetite for learning new things and accomplishing challenging goals in a fast-paced (and not always structured) environment. We are looking for someone that is highly motivated and knows how to get things done quickly and efficiently.\nWe have a product that is changing how brands, agencies and networks measure and assess the impact of TV advertising campaigns. Our software uses proprietary audio and video analysis to monitor and extract TV commercials, movie trailers and other promotional content from TV. At the same time, our software analyzes consumer interactions with TV ads on the digital screen across search, video and social. Interactions are matched with specific ads and attributed back to airings on TV. Our platform collects and analyzes massive amounts of data in real-time.\nThis is a rare opportunity to get equity in the early stages of a company with significant early traction and which is run by an experienced team.\nResponsibilities:\nAs a key member of the custom analytics team, you will be responsible for a variety of business-critical work that includes, but not limited to:\nGathering data from multiple data sources, aggregating and manipulating data for analysis, performing analysis, and creating analysis deliverables in Tableau or other BI tools.\nCommunicating with internal iSpot teams (including Engineering, Customer Success, and Sales) to clarify requirements, resolve technical roadblocks, manage priorities, and summarize insights from analysis.\nQuery from large, complex data sets (using a combination of SQL and Python) to get data that is most relevant for analysis related to TV advertisement measurement. Be proficient in knowing how to join and aggregate potentially large data sets to make sense and provide valuable insight. Be curious about results and have a desire to understand how the data tells a story.\nCreate visualizations and/or tables that organize data in a way that is digestible and makes sense based on the request. Leverage Tableau or other BI tools (Excel, Qlik, etc) to create a customer-ready deliverable.\nWork closely with data engineering and other technical experts to ask questions about data accuracy and validity. You should gain a sense for data that potentially doesn’t look right and communicate concerns whenever you see them.\nDocument project status, updates, roadblocks, resolutions, dependencies, and deliverables in project tracking tool (JIRA).\nAs part of a very collaborative engineering team, you will have access to technical experts that can help you optimize code, point you to the right data, and brainstorm about how to visualize a data set. You should be an open communicator and have a desire to participate in team discussions and help troubleshoot when you have knowledge that a team member might need.\nYou will be expected to manage multiple projects at the same time…not too many, but usually not just one. You should be able to communicate roadblocks and risks proactively…we will have your back when you do!\nIdeally you have some curiosity for the TV ad measurement space and think that tying ad measurement to business outcomes leads to some very interesting, sometimes exploratory, analysis.\n\nRequirements:\n3-5 years of professional experience and bachelor’s degree, including:\n3-5 years as a data analyst, focused on hands-on data gathering, analysis, and visualization.\n2-3 years in a role that required communication to clarify requirements, summarize results, or advise clients on analysis.\nAt least 2 years of experience with Tableau or a similar BI tool is required, including high proficiency in data loading, variable creation, visualization creation and adjustment, and report publishing (both online and via desktop or local channels).\nProficiency in SQL, and R or Python is required. Ability to break down queries to run under processing and memory constraints. You will need to know how to both initiate your own query and also edit/debug an inherited query in some cases.\nMust be able to communicate risks and roadblocks for analysis projects to team leads or VP of Reporting and Analytics.\nMust be able to communicate status of projects clearly for technical and non-technical audiences and independently manage and prioritize assignments.\nStrong attention to detail.\nStrong quantitative, analytical, process development, facilitation and organizational skills required.\nAbility to multi-task and work well under deadlines in a changing environment.\niSpot.TV is an equal opportunity employer.
